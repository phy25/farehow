## About MTA-NYCT Fare Payment

New York City Transit operates the subway and local bus systems serving New York City's five boroughs. The MTA uses the OMNY contactless fare payment system alongside the traditional MetroCard.

### Payment Methods

MTA-NYCT accepts several payment methods:
- **OMNY**: Tap-and-go contactless payment system
- **MetroCard**: Traditional magnetic stripe card (being phased out)
- **Contactless Credit/Debit Cards**: Supported through OMNY
- **Mobile Wallets**: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay via OMNY
- **Cash**: Available at MetroCard vending machines

### Transfer Policy

Free transfers are available between subway and local buses, or between two buses, within a 2-hour window. You must use the same payment method to receive free transfers.

### Important Notes

- OMNY allows passback for open loop payments - multiple people can use the same contactless card
- Weekly fare cap: After 12 trips in a 7-day period, additional rides are free
- No fare cap on MetroCard - only available with OMNY
- Express bus service requires an additional fare
